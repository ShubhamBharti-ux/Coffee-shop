                <p>Founded in 2025, Buddies Coffee Shop started with a simple idea: to serve amazing coffee in a warm,
                    welcoming environment. We believe coffee is more than a drink — it's a daily ritual, a way to
                    connect, and a source of inspiration.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to bring people together, one cup at a time. We proudly brew with locally roasted
                    beans, serve fresh pastries daily, and offer a cozy space where friends become family.</p>
                <p>Whether you're looking for a quiet place to read, catch up on work, or just enjoy a cappuccino with a
                    friend — Bharti’s Coffee Shop is your neighborhood hideaway.</p>
